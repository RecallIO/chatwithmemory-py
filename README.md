# RecallIO Chat

This project offers a small web chat that connects to OpenAI and RecallIO. A Flask backend handles the chat logic while a simple Next.js UI provides a modern interface.

## Backend

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Fill out `config.json` with your OpenAI and RecallIO credentials.
3. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

## Frontend

1. From the `frontend` directory install packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the shown URL in your browser and start chatting.
